""" Technical interview preparation:

    Whiteboard first

Write a function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

    -Prototype: `def find_peak(list_of_integers):`
    -You are not allowed to import any module
    -Your algorithm must have the lowest complexity (hint: you donâ€™t need
     to go through all numbers to find a peak)
    -`6-peak.py` must contain the function
    -`6-peak.txt` must contain the complexity of your
    algorithm: `O(log(n)), O(n), O(nlog(n)) or O(n2)`
    -Note: there may be more than one peak in the list
